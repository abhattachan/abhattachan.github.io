      <p>My <a href="https://search.proquest.com/openview/a2590d9263adba49fe7a9cc9a09852cc/1?pq-origsite=gscholar&amp;cbl=18750&amp;diss=y" target="_blank">dissertation research</a> (2009-2013) explored the potential of the Southern Kalahari as a future dust source. Our primary motivation was driven by the earlier studies in this region by several researchers where they showed that increased aeolian activity was observed during periods of extended drought and relationship between threshold grass cover and aeolian activity in this region. In other drylands around the world, the effect of landuse change on aeolian activity is well established. Study of dust in the Southern Hemisphere are important for further research because, 1) most sources of dust are found in the Northern hemisphere and, 2) the proximity of these dust sources to the Southern Ocean.</p>

<p>We found that the from the interdunes the dust generating potential of the region that receives less than 250 mm mean annual prepciation is similar to the other currently active sources in the regions such as the Makgadikgadi Pan and Etosha Pan <a href="https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1748-9326/7/2/024001" target="_blank">(Bhattachan et al., 2012)</a>. An interesting piece of the puzzle was to determine where this emitted dust will go and what was in the dust. We found that 26% of the trajectories (simulated with a trajectory model, HYSPLIT) reaches the Southern Ocean which is a High Nutrient Low Chlorophyll (HNLC) region where soluble iron (Fe(II)) is a limiting micronutrient. We found the the sediments from the interdunes are rich in soluble iron and could play a role in ocean biogeochemical cycles. We calculated that 0.42 Tg/yr of dust could be emitted from the region in the future under a scenario of 100% vegetation loss <a href="https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/jgrf.20043" target="_blank">(Bhattachan et al., 2013)</a>. In addition to the environmental impacts, the reactivation of dunes also has socioeconomic impacts in the southern Kalahari; for example, loss of palatable grass and rangeland productivity poses a serious threat to the commercial interests and people’s livelihood in the region. One of my disseration chapters focused on the resilience of the duneland vegetation in the overgrazed areas of the southern Kalahari. To this end, I used field observations and soil seed bank experiment to show that palatable perennial grass recovered in dunes after exclusion of grazers <a href="https://esajournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1890/ES13-00268.1" target="_blank">(Bhattachan et al., 2014)</a>. In systems where high resolution continuous data of variables undergoing state changes/regime shifts are not available,ecological indicators such as changes in percent grass cover, grass community composition, and seed bank could serve as effective early warning indicators of state shift.</p>

<p>In my role as a postdoctoral research associate at UVA (2013-2015), I worked to expand the analysis carried out in the Southern Kalahari to other hotspots in the Southern Hemisphere. We showed that agricultural expansion in the Mallee region in Australia could emit dust rich in soluble iron and is likely to be deposited in the Southern Ocean <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/srep06009" target="_blank">(Bhattachan and D’Odorico, 2014)</a>. During Isabel Reche&rsquo;s visit to UVA, we discussed using their dust samples collected in aerosol samplers in the Sierra Nevada mountains in Spain to quantify the enrichment of soluble iron during atmospheric transport from North African dust sources which previously only relied on modeling studies <a href="https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/2016JD025025" target="_blank">(Bhattachan et al., 2016)</a>.</p>

<p>In an ongoing analysis, we analyze the likely depositional footprint of dust emission from continental sources in the Southern Hemisphere and calculate how much of it will likely to be deposited in the Southern Ocean (Talthego et al., in review). A synthesis paper currently in preparation seeks to answer how much carbon would be sequestered via ocean fertilization from the soluble iron contained in the Kalahari dust.</p>
